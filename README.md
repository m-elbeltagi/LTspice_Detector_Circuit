# LTspice_detector_circuit
Requires LTspice to view & run the circuit.
Simulation of the electrical ciruit of the LXe time projection chamber used in my PhD work, along with a simple current source (with some shape and time constraints) to simulate the glitches originating inside the detector. The inital part of the circuit was built by another student, but the later modifications (the glitch simulator, and the glitch detectors) were built by me.
